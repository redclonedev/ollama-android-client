# Ollama Android Client

**Ollama Android Client** is an open-source Android application that provides a graphical user interface for interacting with an Ollama AI instance. It acts as a client-only front end, allowing users to run and chat with local AI models through a simple and intuitive mobile interface.

## Features

- Chat-based interface for AI interaction
- Support for multiple models available in Ollama

- The Android app sends requests to the Ollama API
- Responses are displayed in a user-friendly chat interface

## Use Cases

- Testing and experimenting with Ollama models on Android
- Personal AI assistant front end
- Developer tool for interacting with Ollama APIs

## Requirements
- An active Ollama server
- Network access to the Ollama API
- Android device running a supported Android version

## Tech Stack
